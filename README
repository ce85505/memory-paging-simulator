with weighted memory distribution:
	access per second (10100 in 113.920s): 	88.659
	faults per access: 		0.26218
	average access time: 		5219 us
	
without weighted memory distribution:
	access per second (10100 in 140.968s): 	71.647
	faults per access: 		0.42158
	average access time: 		8358 us

the page replacement algorithm creates fewer faults with the weighted memory requesting scheme because the pages being requested by each process are more likely to already exist in the frame table. the random memory requesting scheme is more realistic in a naive implementation but causes more frequent pagefaults and therefore increases the average time of memory access and decreases the average speed
